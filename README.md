# PhishingEmail
Content I created for phishing email campaign for Penetration Testing Class

### Usage
```https://people.rit.edu/ids1044/index.php?secretCODE=1&email=[target-email]```
- This is how to send the email
```https://people.rit.edu/ids1044/index.php?secretCODE=2```
```https://people.rit.edu/ids1044/index.php```
- These two are equivalent and both record the user's info and send it to the attacker
